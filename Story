I woke up
I got ready for school
I fed my cat, Bella.
My cat is 3 years old
She is a dilute calico short hair cat
she came to our home when she was only a few months old.
she was a stray cat who found shelter on the porch of my friends dad.
I also have a dog.
his name is bamboo and hes a german shepard mix
we adopted him about 7 years ago at PAWS animal shelter
I used to have a gold fish named bubbles.
i won bubbles at a carnival.
he died after a month though.
My first pet was a dog.
he was a rat terrier.
his name was dino.
